# FurGenius AI-Powered Multi-Modal Animal Healthcare Nutrition System

# Problem and Dataset Description

The goal is to classify animals into specific dietary categories (e.g., low-protein diet,
high-fiber diet, post-surgical recovery diet) based on their health conditions and nutritional
needs. This is a multi-class classification problem where the system will predict the most
suitable dietary plan for each animal.

In this project, we will focus on the problem of personalized nutrition planning for animals
using a multi-modal dataset that combines tabular data (e.g., medical records, species-
specific nutritional guidelines) and text data (e.g., veterinary notes, prescriptions). The
dataset will include:
# Tabular Data:
Features such as species, age, weight, medical conditions, and nutritional requirements.
# Text Data:
Unstructured veterinary notes, prescriptions, and dietary recommendations.

# Preliminary Ideas on How You Plan to Address It (Models/Algorithms/Techniques)
# Step 1: Data Preprocessing
# 1. Handling Null Values:
Use imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, or predictive imputation) to address missing data.
# 2. Feature Scaling:
Apply StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to normalize numerical features.
# 3. Categorical Encoding: 
Use One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding for categorical variables.
# 4. Multicollinearity:
Address multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis.
# 5. Text Data Processing:
Clean and preprocess veterinary notes using NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, stemming, lemmatization).

# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# • Visualize data using:
o Scatter Plots: To identify correlations between features (e.g., weight vs.calorie intake).

o Bar Charts: To compare nutritional needs across species or medical conditions.

o Histograms: To analyze the distribution of numerical features (e.g., age, weight).

o Box Plots: To detect outliers in the dataset.

o Heatmaps: To visualize correlation matrices and feature relationships.

# Step 3: Handling Class Imbalance
# • Use imbalanced-learn library to apply:
o Oversampling: Techniques like SMOTE to balance underrepresented classes.

o Undersampling: Techniques like RandomUnderSampler to reduce overrepresented classes.

# Step 4: Feature Selection
• Apply filter-based methods (e.g., correlation coefficients, mutual information).
• Use wrapper-based methods (e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination).
• Implement embedded methods (e.g., LASSO regression).

# Step 5: Model Implementation
# • For tabular data, apply 8+ models, including:

o Logistic Regression

o Decision Trees

o Random Forest

o Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

o Support Vector Machines (SVM)

o k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

o Neural Networks (MLP)

o Ensemble Models (Stacking, Voting)

# • For text data:
fine-tune NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to extract insights from veterinary notes.

# Step 6: Multi-Modal Integration

• Combine tabular and text data using multi-modal architectures (e.g,transformers).

• Use generative AI (e.g., GPT, Stable Diffusion) to create synthetic data for rare conditions.

# Step 7: Hyperparameter Tuning

• Use cross-validation and GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.

# Step 8: Explainable AI

• Implement LIME or SHAP to interpret model predictions and explain feature importance.

# Step 9: Performance Evaluation

• Report metrics such as:

o Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

o Sensitivity, Specificity

o Mean Squared Error (MSE), R2 Score (for regression tasks)

# Software Tools
# • Python Libraries:

o Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

o Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

o Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

o Deep Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face (for NLP)

o Explainable AI: LIME, SHAP

o Imbalanced Data: Imbalanced-learn

o Multi-Modal Integration: Transformers, PyTorch-Geometric (for graph-based models)

# Expected Results and Evaluation--> Expected Results:

o A robust multi-modal model that accurately classifies animals into dietary categories.

o Explainable AI outputs that provide insights into feature importance and model decisions.

o Synthetic data for rare conditions to improve model generalization.
